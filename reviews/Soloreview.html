            <h1>Solo Leveling's long awaited debut as an anime surely did not disappoint</h1>
            
            <p> 
                Solo Leveling's long awaited debut as an anime surely did not disappoint. Written by Chu-Gong and Illustrated by Jang Sung-Rak,
                 the story follows Sung Jin-Woo, a low level hunter who found himself with the unique opportuhnity to improve his standing in the hunters organisation 
                 and make a living for himself to support his sister and sickly mother. 
                At face-value it may seem like the usual zero to hero story. But his overall character development is one to behold as he acquires the "solo leveling" ability.  </p> 
                 
            <p> His journey from a low ranked hunter to ultimately a force to be reckoned with is compellingly portrayed as he grows and discovers new abilities 
                and finds a confidence within himself that not even he was sure that he had </p>
            <p>Season one's excellent pacing is what truly makes Sung's development all the more satisfying as it takes the time to explain the complexities of his new found
                 abilites without losing the watcher in hoards of expositon, but rather masterfulling intertwining in with action pieces that display those abilities in
                  full force showing just how far Sung has come and how far he has to go. Furthermore, as we learn more about these new abilities,
                 the mystery surrounding them provides a level of intrigue that has watchers eagerly anticipating the next episode as well as subsequent seasons. </p>
            <p> One of aspects that solo leveling thrives on is building suspense, with each new skill acquistion,
                 each new dungeon, each new challenge illustrated by the solo leveling system the viewer is left captivated by the prospect 
                 of just how far can Sung go if he's already came so far from where he was. With a mildly fleshed out supporting cast of characters nad provision of ample levels
                  of intrigue that drives the narrative forward with each new revelationn. Solo leveling is truly an
                   enthralling watch for those who love action with a bit of suspense and fantasy. With its impressive character development and world-building 
               it's not hard to see why even prior to its anime adaptation that Solo Leveling has garnered such a dedicated fanbase since the inception of its serialisation. </p>
