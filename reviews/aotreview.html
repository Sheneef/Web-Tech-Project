            <h1>Attack on Titan: The Battle of Heaven and Earth</h1>
            
            <p> The decisive battle of attack on titan encapsulates 10+ years of brilliantly crafted anticipation and narrative excellence whilst audaciously 
                tackling issues that are even present in our own society today. 
                From the inception of the series, we had a clear understanding of who the heroes and villains were, or so we thought. 
                But as the series progressed things were not as black and white as we initially thought, leaving one of the most intriguing grey areas ever depicted in modern media. 
                With the conclusion of this massive hit series that has garnered worldwide acclaim, author Hajime Isayama pulls out no stops in this action-packed
                climax that truly displays a level of despair and emotional taxation like no other.  </p>
                
            <p> This climactic battle melds desperation and chaos as well as the personal struggles of the main cast and the world at large seamlessly. 
                Eren, whose initial goal of the liberation of humanity from the tyranny of the titans takes the form of selfish genocide as he seeks to provide his friends with long prosperous
                lives through the annihilation of all nations who oppose his ideologies. The true highlight of this battle and the overall series is its ability to continue to explore the complexities of morality and human condition.
                Who are the bad guys? Are the Marleyans evil for seeking retribution for the history they were nurtured to believe about the “Devils of Paradis”? After being attacked on multiple occasions by said Marleyans.
                Are Eren and his supporters “The Yeagerists” wrong for wanting to see the world that has ostracised them for their mere existence burn as their allies grow? Naturally as ideologies differ and the lines of morality 
                continue to be blurred, more information about the history of either side being revealed. 
                Relationships and alliances become fractured, enemies become allies, allies become enemies and those involved must face not only the consequences of their actions but the actions of their ancestors and companions.   </p>

                 <h4 class="photocaption">  Eren fighting with the Titan Annie </h4>
    
            <p> The present-day turmoil in tandem with the revelation of past influences leads to epiphanous moments amongst those involved prompting
                 moments of introspection whilst grappling with the world thats being destroyed in front of them. Isayama continued to bring these factors to the forefront as the series progressed all while keeping in line with the thematic motifs 
                that have defined the series from the beginning. Freedom, Sacrifice, the cyclical nature of violence, these themes only add to the despair faced and the inevitable
                 tragic outcome to what happened “From you, 2000 years ago”.  </p>            
                 
                 
            <p> While there is no shortage of superlatives that can be used to describe the narrative excellence of the story, the visuals only serve to augment this masterpiece taking 
                it into the stratosphere of anime royalty. The action sequences, fight choreography and artwork masterfully put words to image to truly show the gravity of what the characters are enduring. 
                Whether it be the haunting images of thousands of colossal titans destroying everything and everyone in their wake, or the insurmountable uphill
                 battle being fought by those barely a fraction of the size of these titans weaving through the boney structure of their ‘comrade’. 
                The story and visuals harmoniously work together in displaying the monstrous consequences of oppression, prejudice, anger, and vengeance.</p>  

            <p> In conclusion, Attack on Titan’s swan song is a testament to the power of immaculate storytelling and its ability to elicit a profound emotional
                 response from its readers and watchers through sticking the landing and leaving them with level of satiety that would encourage them to recommend this series
                  to anyone, anime fan or not. </p>
