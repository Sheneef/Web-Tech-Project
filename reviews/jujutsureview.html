            <h1>Kimi ni Todoke Season 3 coming soon, new season will stream globally via Netflix</h1>
            
            <p> Jujutsu Kaisen's Shibuya Incident Arc was no shortage of excitement, chaos and despair with thrilling accompanying visuals and musical score
                 that would captivate any would-be anime enthusiast looking to embark on a truly entertaining and action-packed experience.
                 One noteworthy aspect of the arc is its impressive pacing. Each chapter balances intense battles with exposition and and momentary instrospection 
                 amongst the colourful cast of characters with the stakes seeming to effortlessly escalate with each passing episode. </p>
                
            <p> Our main character Yuji Itadori, who's the vessel for one of the primary antagonists of the series Ryomen Sukuna, 
                has his moral compass tested as he confronts not only the wide array of villains taking part in the cataclysmic showdown
                 in the Shibuya district but also the darkest aspects of himself and Sukuna's influence.  </p>
    
            <p> Navigating the complexities of his immense power and responsibility to humanity as one of its main defenders. 
                Although he is the main character, he's far from the only person that shines in this arc.
                 The all-powerful enigma that is Satoru Gojo steals the show in many scenes through his unparalelled might and skill as a jujutsu sorcerer
                  as well as his other protoje Megumi Fushiguro, who deals with his own inner conflict whilst contributing to the unfolding narrative around him.
                  Villains such as Jogo are fleshed out even more ironically, humanising someome who despises humanity so much which adds many layers of intrigue to the story.</p>              
            <p> Outside of the captivating overarching plot the Shibuya Incident Arc delves into themes of sacrifice, redemption and the nature and usage of power. 
                Creating grey areas in a plot that at face-value may be perceived as the generic good vs evil debacle. 
                This forces readers an watchers alike to confront the hard questions surrounding morality and consequences of the actions 
                of the current main characters of the story and their predecessors.</p>              
            <p> In conclusion, Jujutsu Kaisen's Shibuya Incident arc undoubtedly captured the attention of long time fans of the series 
                as well as those relatively new to the brilliance of Gege Akutami's writing and artwork,
                 its brilliant story telling and alluring artwork is a must see for anime and manga fans
                 who will be adequatesly satiated by Akutami's work as a storyteller as they patiently await what's in store for season three. </p>
